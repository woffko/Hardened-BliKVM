# Prototype bundle boundary

`scripts/build-prototype-bundle.sh` creates a deterministic, non-installing
development archive. It contains only:

- the verified AArch64 static-PIE server and read-only broker;
- the production frontend without MSW or legacy branding assets;
- reviewed systemd/sysusers templates;
- license, architecture, security, and protocol documentation;
- a machine-readable manifest and per-file checksums.

The archive deliberately contains no credential, test endpoint, private
evidence, updater, install script, device image, recovery claim, or mutation
command. `releaseAccepted` and `deviceAccepted` remain false in its manifest.

File ownership and modes are produced in a Linux `/tmp` staging tree before
the archive is written to D:, avoiding the 0777 mode presentation of the
Windows 9p mount. The tar metadata is sorted, owned by numeric root, and uses
epoch timestamps; gzip timestamps are disabled.

This artifact may be inspected and copied to disposable test storage only
after the device-write gate is approved. It is not a firmware or public
release.

## Verified checkpoint

On 2026-08-30, two independent output directories produced byte-identical
3,224,522-byte commit-bound archives after the zero-warning and strict
same-origin frontend cleanup:

`5d4ef5f3a2c23df594da1d20c98ffc9b35027e67c4bd607adc3d6c0082a3b5bb`

Independent extraction verified every `SHA256SUMS` entry, numeric root archive
ownership, 0755 binaries/directories, 0644 web/docs/manifest files, absence of
symlinks, legacy/MSW assets, host paths, private markers, and test-network
placeholders. The manifest binds the archive to source commit
`0a6082b42778b77ac690ceef292238b90bc9d730`, while both acceptance booleans
remain false; the hash is therefore a development checkpoint, not a release
identifier.
